# 2nd vs 3rd person pronoun frequency in social media comments in relation to various poster and commenter attributes

## Description
The goal of this project is to utilize APIs to examine the prevalence of social media comments featuring 2nd person pronouns (you) and 3rd person pronouns (he/she/they) based on metrics relating to the post or commenter. The findings may be helpful in understanding the psychology behind social media interactions.


From the post-end, I will examine the following factors:
- number of likes/views on the post
- size of poster's following
- follower/following ratio of poster
- number of comments on post
- format of post (photo/video)

From the commenter-end, I will examine the following factors:
- number of comments on the commenter's own posts
- duration for which commenter has been on a platform
- number of posts made by the commenter
- size of commenter's following
- follower/following ratio of commenter

For certain platforms (e.g. YouTube) I can access a full list of a user's comments. In this case, it can be determied whether there is a higher degree of homogeneity for a given user's comments (across different posts) or for a given post's comments (across different users).
